    KiSS helps children access education; it equips them with the skills and knowledge to enable them to build
    a better future for themselves, their families and their communities. For as little as Â£6 a month you can
    sponsor a child and grant them access to the education they deserve. You will receive an introductory email
    about your sponsored child, which will include a picture, a bit about them, where they go to school, and what
    they enjoy. We will update you at the beginning of each new term in Uganda with pictures and information on
    your sponsored child and how they are getting on.
